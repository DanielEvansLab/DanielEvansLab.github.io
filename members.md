## Organizational Structure

![Organizational Chart](/public/images/OrgChart.svg){: .center-image }

Longevity Genomics Research Group members include experts in human and model organism aging, genetic epidemiology of aging, statistical genetics, and chemical informatics. The [Steering Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#SC), [NIA project scientist]({{site.baseurl}}/members#nalini), and the [Project Director]({{site.baseurl}}/members#danevans) provide oversight of all project activities. The [Integrative Data Resource Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#IDRC) assembles genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for pleiotropy analysis, individual-level genetic and phenotype data, eQTL data, and functional genomic annotation in order to perform integrative data analysis. The [Computational Informatics Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#CIC) develops software tools to enable novel integrative genomic analyses that will include Mendelian Randomization analysis. At an annual meeting of the Longevity Genomics Research Group, the [Research Planning Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#RPC) will evaluate statistical methods and translational strategies presented by the Longevity Genomics Research Group, prioritize strategies, and design pilot studies to follow-up the most promising strategies with the goal of advancing the translation of findings into health-promoting therapeutics. In addition, an [External Advisory Board]({{site.baseurl}}/members#EAB) composed of members with expertise in our approaches attends the annual meeting and provides recommendations on strategy prioritization, analytical approaches, and pilot studies. The EAB ensures that scientific members are aware of relevant resources and the EAB members will foster connections with the pharmaceutical industry where appropriate. The EAB will hold an executive session at the end of each annual meeting to formulate their recommendations, followed by a conference call among EAB members to create consensus recommendations that will then be communicated to the Longevity Genomics Research Group in the form of a written document.

### <a name="simonmelov"></a> PI: [Simon Melov](http://www.buckinstitute.org/melovLab){:target="_blank"} - Buck Institute for Research on Aging

<img align="right" title="Simon Melov" src="/public/images/members/simon_melov.png"><img/>
Simon Melov, who heads the Institute’s Genomic Core, explores the role of the
energy-making units inside cells, the mitochondria, which produce a chemical
fuel that powers the cell’s work but which also release damaging “free
radicals’’ that are linked to disease. The Melov lab studies proteins that help
the mitochondria detoxify free radicals and tracks the decline of function in
mitochondria that comes with age. Other research interests include the
age-related bone disorder osteoporosis, age-related heart disease, the role of
methylation in the aging human genome, and developing molecular techniques to
better understand single cell changes with age. In a landmark study, Dr. Melov
and collaborators showed that the more vigorous pattern of gene expression
found in young adults could be partially restored in older adults who followed
an strength training exercise program for 6 months. The Melov lab looks for
broader genetic fingerprints of aging by surveying the patterns of gene
activity in various animals, including human beings, mice, and the nematode
worm C. elegans.

<img align="right" title="Michael Snyder" src="/public/images/members/snyder.jpg"><img/>
Michael Snyder is the Stanford Ascherman Professor and Chair of Genetics and the Director of the Center of Genomics and Personalized Medicine. Dr. Snyder received his Ph.D. training at the California Institute of Technology and carried out postdoctoral training at Stanford University. He is a leader in the field of functional genomics and proteomics, and one of the major participants of the ENCODE project. His laboratory study was the first to perform a large-scale functional genomics project in any organism, and has developed many technologies in genomics and proteomics. These including the development of proteome chips, high resolution tiling arrays for the entire human genome, methods for global mapping of transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-chip now replaced by ChIP-seq), paired end sequencing for mapping of structural variation in eukaryotes, de novo genome sequencing of genomes using high throughput technologies and RNA-Seq. These technologies have been used for characterizing genomes, proteomes and regulatory networks. Seminal findings from the Snyder laboratory include the discovery that much more of the human genome is transcribed and contains regulatory information than was previously appreciated, and a high diversity of transcription factor binding occurs both between and within species. He has also combined different state-of–the-art “omics” technologies to perform the first longitudinal detailed integrative personal omics profile (iPOP) of person and used this to assess disease risk and monitor disease states for personalized medicine. He is a cofounder of several biotechnology companies, including Protometrix (now part of Life Technologies), Affomix (now part of Illumina), Excelix, and Personalis, and he presently serves on the board of a number of companies.

<img align="right" title="Maria Glymour" src="/public/images/members/glymour.jpg"><img/>
My research focuses on how social factors experienced across the lifecourse, from infancy to adulthood, influence cognitive function, dementia, stroke, and other health outcomes in old age. A separate theme of my research focuses on overcoming methodological challenges encountered in analyses of social determinants of health, and cognitive outcomes in particular. Many of these challenges are being addressed in the MELODEM (MEthods in LOngitudinal research on DEMentia) initiative, an international group of researchers focusing on analytic challenges in research on dementia and cognitive aging. MELODEM is organized into working groups on measurement, selection/survival, time-scale definitions, complex confounding, high-dimensional data. 

I have advocated the use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as a standard research tool to represent our causal hypotheses and help elucidate potential biases in proposed analyses. In other cases, the methodological problems require more analytical solutions that have been developed elsewhere in epidemiology or in other disciplines, but are rarely applied to these research questions. Instrumental variables analyses of natural or induced experiments are one promising example. Genetic variations have recently been advanced as possible instrumental variables to estimate the health effects of a wide range of phenotypes, an approach sometimes called “Mendelian Randomization.” Using genetic polymorphisms as instrumental variables could provide a very powerful tool for social epidemiology, but the inferences from such analyses rest on strong assumptions. Thus I am currently working with a team to explore approaches to evaluating the plausibility of those assumptions in applications for social epidemiology.

My laboratory applies genetics and genome science to drug discovery and development. We integrate molecular and computational tools for drug pathway discovery, target validation and biomarker discovery. The team uses a range of tools in human genetics and genomics, including high-throughput gene expression, microarrays and next-generation sequencing. A focus of the team is applications of human genetics to drug target discovery and patient stratification. We seek to discover novel genetic associations with disease or drug response, and to unravel the biology of known and novel genetic variants. These studies increasingly rely on integrating genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data. By working closely with clinical researchers and computational biologists, we aim to translate basic research discoveries into new drug targets and biomarkers.
