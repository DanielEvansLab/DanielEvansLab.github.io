## Organizational Structure

Our [scientific team](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/members) includes experts in human and model organism aging, genetic epidemiology of aging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, and pharmaceutical development. The steering committee includes the three PIs (Steve Cummings, Nik Schork, and Simon Melov), an NIA project scientist (Nalini Raghavachari), and the project director (Dan Evans). The Integrative Data Resource Committee (IDRC) will assemble multiple genomic data resources and perform integrative data analysis. The Computational Informatics Committee (CIC) will develop software tools that will enable novel integrative genomic analyses that will include Mendelian Randomization analysis. The Research Planning Committee (RPC) will meet annually to evaluate evidence from our statistical analyses and to develop pilot projects that will be performed to advance the translation of findings into health-promoting therapeutics. In addition, an External Advisory Board (EAB) will be formed to provide relevant scientific expertise and to foster connections with the pharmaceutical industry.

## More About Members


### <a name="stevecummings"></a> PI: Steve Cummings - California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute (CPMCRI)

<img align="right" title="Steve Cummings" src="/public/images/members/steve_cummings.png"><img/>
[[Home page](http://www.cpmc.org/professionals/research/programs/science/cummings.html)]

Dr. Steven R. Cummings is Director of the SF Coordinating Center, a joint research operation of the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute and the University of California Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Dr Cummings is an emeritus Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Associate Chair for Clinical Research at the University of California, San Francisco. 

The Coordinating Center specializes in coordinating multi-center studies in women’s health, aging, cognitive function, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer prevention, osteoporosis, arthritis, and dementia. The Coordinating Center is also the center for a major NIA-sponsored effort to identify genetic variants controlling longevity and aging. 

In 1996, Dr. Cummings was elected to the American Association of Physicians and to the Council of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. In 2000, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine in the National Academy of Science. 

With support of the Daniel and Phyllis Da Costa Fund, Dr. Cummings is collaborating with researchers at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, whose mission is to find ways to identify women at high risk for breast cancer. Together, they plan to develop new methods that can predict a woman’s chance of developing the disease, as well as learn about potential means for prevention.

### <a name="danevans"></a> Dan Evans - California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute (CPMCRI)

Dan Evans and colleagues at CPMCRI and the San Francisco Coordinating Center are using high-throughput and sequencing methods to study age-related diseases. Their research focuses on three areas:

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteoarthritis to identify genetic variants associated with this condition, which affects approximately 40% of people aged 70 and older. Projects are underway to uncover the functional impact of associated genetic variants, which will help shed light on the biological processes underlying osteoarthritis.

Identification of genetic variants associated with sleep traits: Changes in the timing and quality of sleep occur as humans age. A highly conserved set of genes, termed “clock genes,” regulate circadian processes including sleep in diverse organisms. Dr. Evans and colleagues found that genetic variants in clock genes are associated with sleep timing and quality in the elderly. They are investigating the relationship between clock gene variants and other age-related traits to better understand the connection between circadian biology and aging. 

Understanding and comparing population-specific genetic variation in complex human traits: Most GWAS have been conducted in European populations; performing GWAS in non-European populations can help identify novel genetic associations due to population-specific genetic variation. Dr. Evans’ cross-population studies focus on complex heritable quantitative traits related to heart function, specifically the conduction of excitatory electrical signals.

Nicholas J. Schork is a Professor and Director of Human Biology at the J. Craig
Venter Institute (JCVI). He is also an adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and
Family and Preventive Medicine (Division of Biostatistics) at the University of
California, San Diego (UCSD). Prior to joining JCVI, Dr. Schork was, from
2007-2013, a Professor, Molecular and Experimental Medicine, at The Scripps
Research Institute (TSRI), Director of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at the
Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI), and Director of Research at
Scripps Genomic Medicine, a division of Scripps Health. From 2001-2007 Dr.
Schork was a Professor of Biostatistics and Psychiatry, and Co-Director of the
Center for Human Genetics and Genomics, at UCSD. From 1994-2000, he was an
Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, Ohio, and an Adjunct Associate Professor of
Biostatistics at Harvard University. During 1999 and 2000, Dr. Schork took a
sponsored leave of absence from CWRU to conduct research as the Vice President
of Statistical Genomics at the French biotechnology company, Genset, where he
helped guide efforts to construct the first high-density map of the human
genome. - See more at: http://www.jcvi.org/cms/about/bios/nschork/#sthash.iqMhFD7k.dpuf

### <a name="simonmelov"></a> Simon Melov - Buck Institute for Research on Aging
<img align="right" title="Nik Schork" src="/public/images/members/simon_melov.png"><img/>
[[Home page](http://www.buckinstitute.org/melovLab)]

Simon Melov, who heads the Institute’s Genomic Core, explores the role of the
energy-making units inside cells, the mitochondria, which produce a chemical
fuel that powers the cell’s work but which also release damaging “free
radicals’’ that are linked to disease. The Melov lab studies proteins that help
the mitochondria detoxify free radicals and tracks the decline of function in
mitochondria that comes with age. Other research interests include the
age-related bone disorder osteoporosis, age-related heart disease, the role of
methylation in the aging human genome, and developing molecular techniques to
better understand single cell changes with age. In a landmark study, Dr. Melov
and collaborators showed that the more vigorous pattern of gene expression
found in young adults could be partially restored in older adults who followed
an strength training exercise program for 6 months. The Melov lab looks for
broader genetic fingerprints of aging by surveying the patterns of gene
activity in various animals, including human beings, mice, and the nematode
worm C. elegans.

Tyler Backman is a graduate student at the Bioengineering program at the
University California, Riverside.
His research interests include computational drug design and discovery,
mathematical modeling of biological feedback systems, and inference from weak
and noisy data. I am currently developing computational tools to identify new
small molecule drugs and drug targets for the treatment of human disease.

Thomas Girke is a Professor of Bioinformatics at the University California,
Riverside. He received his Ph.D. from the University Hamburg, Germany. His
research focuses on the development of computational data analysis methods for
genome biology and small molecule discovery. 
This includes discovery-oriented data mining projects, as well as algorithm and software development projects

generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide profiling approaches and chemical
genomics. As part of the multidisciplinary nature of his field, he frequently
collaborates with experimental scientists on data analysis projects of complex
biological networks. Another important activity is the development of
integrated data analysis systems for the open source software projects R and
Bioconductor.
