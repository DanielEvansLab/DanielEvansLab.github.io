## Organizational Structure

Our [scientific team](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/members) includes experts in human and model organism aging, genetic epidemiology of aging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, and pharmaceutical development. The steering committee includes the three PIs (Steve Cummings, Nik Schork, and Simon Melov), an NIA project scientist (Nalini Raghavachari), and the project director (Dan Evans). The Integrative Data Resource Committee (IDRC) will assemble multiple genomic data resources and perform integrative data analysis. The Computational Informatics Committee (CIC) will develop software tools that will enable novel integrative genomic analyses that will include Mendelian Randomization analysis. The Research Planning Committee (RPC) will meet annually to evaluate evidence from our statistical analyses and to develop pilot projects that will be performed to advance the translation of findings into health-promoting therapeutics. In addition, an External Advisory Board (EAB) will be formed to provide relevant scientific expertise and to foster connections with the pharmaceutical industry.

Dr. Steven R. Cummings is Director of the SF Coordinating Center, a joint research operation of the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute and the University of California Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Dr Cummings is an emeritus Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Associate Chair for Clinical Research at the University of California, San Francisco. 

The Coordinating Center specializes in coordinating multi-center studies in women’s health, aging, cognitive function, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer prevention, osteoporosis, arthritis, and dementia. The Coordinating Center is also the center for a major NIA-sponsored effort to identify genetic variants controlling longevity and aging. 

In 1996, Dr. Cummings was elected to the American Association of Physicians and to the Council of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. In 2000, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine in the National Academy of Science. 

With support of the Daniel and Phyllis Da Costa Fund, Dr. Cummings is collaborating with researchers at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, whose mission is to find ways to identify women at high risk for breast cancer. Together, they plan to develop new methods that can predict a woman’s chance of developing the disease, as well as learn about potential means for prevention.

Dan Evans and colleagues at CPMCRI and the San Francisco Coordinating Center are using high-throughput and sequencing methods to study age-related diseases. Their research focuses on three areas:

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteoarthritis to identify genetic variants associated with this condition, which affects approximately 40% of people aged 70 and older. Projects are underway to uncover the functional impact of associated genetic variants, which will help shed light on the biological processes underlying osteoarthritis.

Identification of genetic variants associated with sleep traits: Changes in the timing and quality of sleep occur as humans age. A highly conserved set of genes, termed “clock genes,” regulate circadian processes including sleep in diverse organisms. Dr. Evans and colleagues found that genetic variants in clock genes are associated with sleep timing and quality in the elderly. They are investigating the relationship between clock gene variants and other age-related traits to better understand the connection between circadian biology and aging. 

Understanding and comparing population-specific genetic variation in complex human traits: Most GWAS have been conducted in European populations; performing GWAS in non-European populations can help identify novel genetic associations due to population-specific genetic variation. Dr. Evans’ cross-population studies focus on complex heritable quantitative traits related to heart function, specifically the conduction of excitatory electrical signals.

Thomas Girke is a Professor of Bioinformatics at the University California,
Riverside. He received his Ph.D. from the University Hamburg, Germany. His
research focuses on the development of computational data analysis methods for
genome biology and small molecule discovery. 
This includes discovery-oriented data mining projects, as well as algorithm and software development projects
for data types from a variety of high-throughput technologies such as next
generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide profiling approaches and chemical
genomics. As part of the multidisciplinary nature of his field, he frequently
collaborates with experimental scientists on data analysis projects of complex
biological networks. Another important activity is the development of
integrated data analysis systems for the open source software projects R and
Bioconductor.
