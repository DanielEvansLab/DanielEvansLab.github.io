## Organizational Structure

![Organizational Chart](/public/images/OrgChart.svg){: .center-image }

Longevity Genomics Research Group members include experts in human and model organism aging, genetic epidemiology of aging, statistical genetics, and chemical informatics. The [Steering Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#SC), [NIA project scientist]({{site.baseurl}}/members#nalini), and the [Project Director]({{site.baseurl}}/members#danevans) provide oversight of all project activities. The [Integrative Data Resource Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#IDRC) assembles genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for pleiotropy analysis, individual-level genetic and phenotype data, eQTL data, and functional genomic annotation in order to perform integrative data analysis. The [Computational Informatics Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#CIC) develops software tools to enable novel integrative genomic analyses that will include Mendelian Randomization analysis. At an annual meeting of the Longevity Genomics Research Group, the [Research Planning Committee]({{site.baseurl}}/members#RPC) will evaluate statistical methods and translational strategies presented by the Longevity Genomics Research Group, prioritize strategies, and design pilot studies to follow-up the most promising strategies with the goal of advancing the translation of findings into health-promoting therapeutics. In addition, an [External Advisory Board]({{site.baseurl}}/members#EAB) composed of members with expertise in our approaches attends the annual meeting and provides recommendations on strategy prioritization, analytical approaches, and pilot studies. The EAB ensures that scientific members are aware of relevant resources and the EAB members will foster connections with the pharmaceutical industry where appropriate. The EAB will hold an executive session at the end of each annual meeting to formulate their recommendations, followed by a conference call among EAB members to create consensus recommendations that will then be communicated to the Longevity Genomics Research Group in the form of a written document.

### <a name="stevecummings"></a> PI: [Steve Cummings](http://www.cpmc.org/professionals/research/programs/science/cummings.html) - California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute (CPMCRI)

<img align="right" title="Steve Cummings" src="/public/images/members/steve_cummings.png"><img/>
Dr. Steven R. Cummings is Director of the SF Coordinating Center, a joint research operation of the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute and the University of California Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Dr Cummings is an emeritus Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Associate Chair for Clinical Research at the University of California, San Francisco. 

The Coordinating Center specializes in coordinating multi-center studies in women’s health, aging, cognitive function, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer prevention, osteoporosis, arthritis, and dementia. The Coordinating Center is also the center for a major NIA-sponsored effort to identify genetic variants controlling longevity and aging. 

In 1996, Dr. Cummings was elected to the American Association of Physicians and to the Council of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. In 2000, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine in the National Academy of Science. 

With support of the Daniel and Phyllis Da Costa Fund, Dr. Cummings is collaborating with researchers at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, whose mission is to find ways to identify women at high risk for breast cancer. Together, they plan to develop new methods that can predict a woman’s chance of developing the disease, as well as learn about potential means for prevention.

### <a name="simonmelov"></a> [Simon Melov](http://www.buckinstitute.org/melovLab) - Buck Institute for Research on Aging

<img align="right" title="Simon Melov" src="/public/images/members/simon_melov.png"><img/>
Simon Melov, who heads the Institute’s Genomic Core, explores the role of the
energy-making units inside cells, the mitochondria, which produce a chemical
fuel that powers the cell’s work but which also release damaging “free
radicals’’ that are linked to disease. The Melov lab studies proteins that help
the mitochondria detoxify free radicals and tracks the decline of function in
mitochondria that comes with age. Other research interests include the
age-related bone disorder osteoporosis, age-related heart disease, the role of
methylation in the aging human genome, and developing molecular techniques to
better understand single cell changes with age. In a landmark study, Dr. Melov
and collaborators showed that the more vigorous pattern of gene expression
found in young adults could be partially restored in older adults who followed
an strength training exercise program for 6 months. The Melov lab looks for
broader genetic fingerprints of aging by surveying the patterns of gene
activity in various animals, including human beings, mice, and the nematode
worm C. elegans.
