title: Project 2 Functional annotation based gene prioritization
---


* **LAG identification from longevity-associated variants (LAVs)**

Association regions marked by LAVs and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) are typically broad and encompass multiple genes. We use functional genomic annotation to prioritize candidate LAGs within association regions.
