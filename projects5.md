title: Project 5 - Drugs targeting LAGs
---


### Background


* **Drug identification for translational strategies**

Convincing evidence linking LAGs to longevity will serve as a foundation for the search for small molecule compounds that might mimic the collective effect of genetic instrumental variables. By identifying small molecules based on therapeutic hypotheses relating molecular function to healthy aging, effective translational research strategies can be developed and pilot studies can be designed. These findings will be disseminated to the research community.

**Longevity drug collection** 
This collection will consist of drugs identified in the "Connecting drug- and age-related gene expression signatures" project, as well as drugs that target gene products identified in the "MR analysis of eSNPs and longevity" project.
