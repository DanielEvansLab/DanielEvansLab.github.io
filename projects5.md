title: Project 5 - Drugs targeting LAGs
---


### Background

**Drug identification for translational strategies**

Convincing evidence linking LAGs to longevity will serve as a foundation for the search for small molecule compounds that might mimic the effect of LAGs. By identifying small molecules based on therapeutic hypotheses relating molecular function to healthy aging, effective translational research strategies can be developed and pilot studies can be designed. These findings will be disseminated to the research community.

Candidate chemical interventions could either modulate the activity of the protein coded be a LAG or could induce a gene expression pattern associated with healthy aging. Our current projects focus on the latter.

### Approach

Compare age-related gene expression signatures with those from drug treatments. 

### Data

The age-related query signatures are from recent publications such as [Peters et al., 2015)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26490707){:target="_blank"} and  [Sood et al., 2015)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26343147){:target="_blank"}, while the drug-related reference signatures are from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) and LINCS projects [Lamb et al., 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17008526){:target="_blank"}.

### Software

We are currently developing the [longevityTools R Package on GitHub)](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools){:target="_blank"}, and preliminary vignettes are available at the [longevityTools website](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/longevityTools/mydoc/home.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Example results

Below is an example figure demonstrating the linkage between small molecule activity and gene expression, followed by cluster analysis of chemical structure.

**Longevity drug collection** 
This collection will consist of drugs identified in the "Connecting drug- and age-related gene expression signatures" project, as well as drugs that target gene products identified in the "MR analysis of eSNPs and longevity" project.
