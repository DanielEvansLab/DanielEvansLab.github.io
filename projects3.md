title: project 3 Mendelian Randomization
---


### Background

A central theme in our project is to develop insights relating molecular and physiologic factors that can be pharmacologically manipulated to promote healthy aging based on hypotheses rooted in genetic association studies of longevity. To develop causal associations with human longevity, we employ a Mendelian Randomization approach.

The Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach has been described in Davey Smith G, Ebrahim S. 'Mendelian randomization': can genetic epidemiology contribute to understanding environmental determinants of disease? Int J Epidemiol. 2003; 32:1-22. The appeal of MR is that this approach can be used to identify causal associations between a potentially modifiable risk factor and an outcome. A major challenge for observational studies is to identify causal associations, which is due, at least in part, to the influence of confounding factors. A confounder is a third factor that is a common cause of a risk factor and the outcome.

MR is an approach that is designed to largely avoid the influence of confounders by employing genetic variants associated with the risk factor of interest. Genetic variants are determined at conception, and as such, are not subject to the effects of confounders. In other words, very few potential confounders can alter a person's DNA in all of the tissues relevant to the disease under study. The term Mendelian Randomization refers to the fact that the random assortment of a risk-factor associated allele at conception is analogous to the random assignment of treatment in a randomized controlled trial. Genetic predictors of risk factors can be used as instrumental variables to approximate a lifetime exposure to a risk factor of interest, e.g., increased HDL levels or increased expression of a particular gene, and these genetic instrumental variables (gIVs) can then be used to estimate the unconfounded association between the risk factor and the outcome.

### Approach

### Data


We will also share our phenotype harmonization approaches that will enable us and others to analyze meaningful human aging traits. These resources will be provided directly through this website or through links to external resources. We will direct users to external resources that store data collected from longitudinal cohort studies with genome-wide genotype and sequence data.
