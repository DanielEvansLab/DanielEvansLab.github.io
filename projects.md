To maximize the sharability and reproducibility of the data analysis results generated 
by this project, most of its analysis routines are implemented as R packages 
(_e.g._ [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)). 
The main source of documentation are the vignettes and help files provided by the R 
package(s). All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given
in the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users
can also download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the
vignettes or directly from the
[Downloads](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/downloads/) page of this site.
