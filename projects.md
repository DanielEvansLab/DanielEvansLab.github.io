## A. Overview

> An overview of the Longevity Genomics project is given on the [landing
page]({{site.baseurl}}/) of this web site. This Projects page provides links to
technical descriptions of the individual project components in form of
vignettes containing detailed analysis protocols along with well defined
objectives, descriptions of findings and downloads of relevant results. 

## B. Collaboration and Open Access

To maximize shareability and reproducibility of the data analysis results
generated by this project, most of its analysis routines will be implemented as
R packages hosted on GitHub (_e.g._ [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)). 
At a later stage, suitable components will be contributed to the Bioconductor project. The main 
source of documentation for both users and developers are the vignettes and help files provided by the R packages
(for an example see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given in
the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users can
also download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the
vignettes or directly from the
[Downloads]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/)
page of this site.
While improving transparency for external users, the chosen analysis strategy 
greatly facilitates collaborations among the different teams and members 
of this project. Where appropriate, finalized summary results will be made 
accessible via web-based solutions in the future such as [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and
[ReportingTools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html).

## D. Getting started
To install an R package from GitHub, user want to open R in their favorite environemt
(_e.g._ [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/)
or [VIM-R](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r/vim-r))
and then execute the following commands (here for [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)) from the 
R console:

{% highlight s %}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("tgirke/longevityTools", build_vignettes=FALSE)
library(longevityTools)
{% endhighlight %}

Subsequently, the vignettes of the installed package can be opened in an
internet browser, from within RStudio or one can access them with this command:

{% highlight s %}
vignette(topic="longevityTools", package="longevityTools")
{% endhighlight %}

Now, users want to follow the instructions given in the vignette (_e.g._
[longevityTools vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools_CMAP.html){:target="_blank"}).
To avoid typing and/or tedious copy&paste routines for executing code, users
should load the corresponding source file
([\*.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/longevityTools/master/vignettes/longevityTools.R)
or [\*.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/longevityTools/master/vignettes/longevityTools.Rmd))
into their R working environment and then make use of built-in code sending or
sourcing functionalities. In addition, an entire workflow can be re-run with the
following command or by pushing the `built` button in RStudio, while the content in the corresponding vignette will be updated in real time. 
This includes all its text, code, tables, images and all results written to files.

{% highlight r %}
rmarkdown::render('longevityTools.Rmd'); Stangle("longevityTools.Rmd")
{% endhighlight %}
