## A. Overview

See [here]({{site.baseurl}}/).

## B. Collaboration and Open Access

To maximize shareability and reproducibility of the data analysis results
generated by this project, most of its analysis routines will be implemented as
R packages (_e.g._ [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools))
hosted on GitHub. At a later stage, suitable components will also be contributed 
to the Bioconductor project. The main 
source of documentation for both users and developers are the vignettes and help files provided by the R packages
(for an example see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given in
the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users can
also download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the
vignettes or directly from the
[Downloads]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/)
page of this site.
While improving transparency for external users, the chosen analysis strategy
also greatly facilitates collaborations among the different teams and members 
of this project. Where appropriate, finalized summary results will also be made 
accessible via web-based solutions in the future such as [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and
[ReportingTools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html).

## D. Getting started
To install a chosen R package, user want to open R in their favorite environemt
(_e.g._ [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/)
or [VIM-R](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r/vim-r))
and then execute the following commands (here for [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)) from the 
R console:

{% highlight s %}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("tgirke/longevityTools", build_vignettes=TRUE, dependencies=TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

Subsequently, the vignette of the installed package can be opened in an
internet browser, from within RStudio or one can access it with this command:

{% highlight s %}
vignette("longevityTools")
{% endhighlight %}

Now, users want to follow the instructions given in the vignette (_e.g._ [longevityTools vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
To execute code without tedious copy and paste routines, users should load the corresponding source files ([\*.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/longevityTools/master/vignettes/longevityTools.R) 
or [\*.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/longevityTools/master/vignettes/longevityTools.Rmd)) into their working environment.
