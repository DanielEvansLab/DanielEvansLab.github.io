## A. Overview

To maximize sharability and reproducibility of the data analysis results
generated by this project, most of its analysis routines are implemented as R
packages (_e.g._ [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)).
The main source of documentation are the vignettes and help files provided by
the R packages (for an example see
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given in
the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users can
also download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the
vignettes or directly from the
[Downloads](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/downloads/) page of this site. The
chosen analysis environment also greatly facilitates collaboration among the 
different team members of this project.

## C. Getting started
To install a chosen R package, user want to open R in their favorite environemt
(_e.g._ [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/)
or [VIM-R](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r/vim-r))
and then execute the following commands (here for [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)) from the 
R console:

{% highlight s %}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("tgirke/longevityTools", build_vignettes=TRUE, dependencies=TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

Subsequently, open the package vignette in a browser, open it from withing RStudio or access
it with this command:

{% highlight s %}
vignette("longevityTools")
{% endhighlight %}

Now follow the instruction in the vignette (_e.g._ [longevityTools vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
