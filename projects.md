Our overall approach to develop translational strategies is to employ multiple approaches to identify potential longevity-associated genes (LAGs), followed by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the potential impact modulating LAG activity might have on longevity. To provide a means through which LAG activity can be modulated, small molecule compounds that target LAGs are identified. 

The flowchart below describes the steps we take to move from longevity-associated variants (LAVs) to candidate LAGs, which are then evaluated as translational targets using Mendelian Randomization. Please click on green icons to learn more about specific projects.

## Collaboration and Open Access

To maximize shareability and reproducibility of the data analysis results
generated by this project, most of its analysis routines will be implemented as
R packages hosted on GitHub (_e.g._ [longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)). 
At a later stage, suitable components will be contributed to the Bioconductor project. The main 
source of documentation for both users and developers are the vignettes and help files provided by the R packages.
All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given in the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users will also be able to download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the vignettes or directly from this site. While improving transparency for external users, the chosen analysis strategy greatly facilitates collaborations among the different teams and members of this project. Where appropriate, finalized summary results will be made accessible via web-based solutions in the future such as [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} and
[ReportingTools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html){:target="_blank"}.
