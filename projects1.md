title: Project 1 - LAV identification
---

Two approaches are taken to identify Longevity-Associated Variants (LAVs). 

* Identification of longevity-associated variants (LAVs) from GWAS of longevity

### Rationale

Key genes and genetic networks that modulate human aging can be identified from human genetic studies of longevity. Hypothesis-driven candidate gene association studies based on findings from model organisms have identified several variants associated with longevity or decreased mortality rates in humans, including variants in/near lipoprotein metabolism genes, APOE, FOXO3A, insulin/IGF1 signaling genes, LMNA, RNA editing genes, and HSF2. Identifying genome-wide significant (P≤5x10^-8^) longevity associations from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been challenging, and until recently, variants near the APOE gene represented the only genome-wide significant associations. The longevity associations among variants in the APOE gene region were found to be dependent on the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, and as these variant alleles were associated with decreased odds of longevity, they did not represent obvious candidates for translation to longevity-promoting therapies. A recent GWAS meta-analysis of longevity, defined as reaching age 90 years or older, conducted by a consortium of European cohorts identified a novel longevity-associated variant (LAV), rs2149954 near the gene EBF1, and the rs2149954 minor allele was associated with increased odds of longevity. A GWAS meta-analysis of longevity performed by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium using the same definition of longevity as Deelen et al. but a more precise definition for non-longevity-achieving controls, did not identify a genome-wide significant longevity association in their discovery cohorts. However, the meta-analysis of the CHARGE discovery results with published results for the FOXO3 variant rs2802292 revealed that the G allele was associated with increased odds of longevity at the genome-wide significance level (OR=1.17, P=1.9x10^-10^). 

LAVs are identified using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human longevity and lifespan. Our meta-analysis of the two largest GWAS meta-analyses of reaching age 90 represents the largest GWAS meta-analysis of longevity to-date.

* **Identification of LAVs from pleiotropy analysis**

LAVs are expected to impact the fundamental process of aging, and as such, should have the property of being associated with multiple age-related traits and diseases.  To further contribute to LAV identification, we will search for variants with evidence of pleiotropic effects on subclinical risk factors for age-associated diseases and for age-related diseases.
