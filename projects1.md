title: Project 1 - LAV identification
---

* **Identification of longevity-associated variants (LAVs) from GWAS of longevity**

LAVs are identified using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human longevity and lifespan. Our meta-analysis of the two largest GWAS meta-analyses of reaching age 90 represents the largest GWAS meta-analysis of longevity to-date. 

* **Identification of LAVs from pleiotropy analysis**

To further contribute to LAV identification, we will search for variants with evidence of pleiotropic effects on subclinical risk factors for age-associated diseases and for age-related diseases.
