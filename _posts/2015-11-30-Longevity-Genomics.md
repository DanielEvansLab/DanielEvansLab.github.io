### Welcome

You have reached the website for the [Longevity Genomics](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/) research group, an [NIA funded resource-related cooperative agreement]({{site.baseurl}}/#funding). Through the navigation menu **â˜°** in the top corner, you will find pages describing our members, research projects, and open source data, tools, and resources that enable us and others to design translational strategies to promote healthy human aging based on genetic variants associated with longevity. 

### Project Summary

Our overall approach, as outlined in the flowchart below, is to use **Longevity-Associated Variants (LAVs)**, gene-expression studies, and evidence from model organisms to identify **Longevity-Associated Genes (LAGs)**. **Mendelian Randomization (MR)** analysis will evaluate the potential impact modulating LAG activity might have on longevity, and candidate **Longevity-Associated Drugs (LADs)** targeting LAGs will be identified. To learn more about specific projects, please click on the green icons and visit our [project overview]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) page.

### Project Goals 

1. Create a research resource that is publicly available through this website to enable scientists to develop translational strategies to promote human longevity. Our publicly-available infrastructure will include the following.
  + **Software tools** in the form of R packages and analysis walkthroughs in the form of vignettes that will enable researchers to adopt and extend our analytical methods. 
  + **Datasets** used by our project. Datasets will include genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association results for human age-related traits, functional human genomic annotation, information from tissue-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, and datasets of chemical properties and protein targets of small molecule compounds.   
  + **Results** generated through our research. Results will include annotated genome-wide SNP association results, genetic instrumental variables that can be used in Mendelian Randomization analysis, expression profiles associated with traits relevant to human aging, and small molecule compounds targeting genes of interest and expression profiles associated with human aging.
  + Armed with our data resources and software tools, outside researchers will be able to reproduce our results and extend our approaches to their own datasets. For those who prefer to browse results, our results will be available as downloadable files and through web-based solutions such as [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} and [ReportingTools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html){:target="_blank"}, where appropriate. 

2. Develop translational strategies to promote human longevity using our research resource. Our translational strategies are based on the identification of modifiable factors that can be pharmacologically targeted and that are causally related to healthy human aging. Together with our Research Planning Committee, we will design pilot studies to test the feasibility of prioritized translational strategies and we will provide small funding opportunities for scientists to perform these pilot studies. 

### Updates

Users should be aware that this site is still a work in progress due to the early stage of the project. Many components of this site are under heavy development. In the coming months, genomic resources and analytical approaches will be made available on this website that will enable others in the field to perform in-depth integrative genomic analyses using their own data.
