### Project Summary

Human longevity is heritable, and statistically and biologically compelling genetic associations with longevity and age-related traits have been identified.  The translation of these genetic associations into insights that can lead to pharmacological interventions designed to promote healthy aging requires an approach and infrastructure that integrates many genomic resources. 

To address this challenge, we have established the [Longevity Genomics](http://DanielEvansLab.github.io) research group, an NIA funded research project to develop an integrative genomic resource and infrastructure to develop translational strategies to promote human longevity. Our infrastructure will include data from longitudinal cohort studies with genome-wide genotype and sequence data, computational methods for annotating genetic variants, information from tissue-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, and datasets of chemical properties and protein targets of small molecule compounds. 

A central theme in our project is to develop insights relating molecular and physiologic factors that can be pharmacologically manipulated to healthy aging based on hypotheses rooted in genetic association studies of longevity. Candidate genetic variants will be identified for in-depth analysis, and genes likely to be modulated by candidate genetic variants will be identified using functional genomic annotation resources. Tissue-specific genetic instrumental variables for these genes will be constructed to enable Mendelian Randomization analysis to identify causal connections between gene products and healthy aging. Healthy aging phenotypes will be based on data from longitudinal cohort studies, which will include incident disability, incident disease and chronic conditions, and change in physical and cognitive function. Results from these analyses will serve as a foundation for the search for small molecule compounds that might mimic the collective effect of genetic instrumental variables. By identifying small molecules based on therapeutic hypotheses relating molecular function to healthy aging, effective translational research strategies can be developed and disseminated to the research community.

### Organizational Structure

Our [scientific team](http://DanielEvansLab.github.io/members) includes experts in human and model organism aging, genetic epidemiology of aging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, and pharmaceutical development. The steering committee includes the three PIs (Steve Cummings, Nik Schork, and Simon Melov), an NIA project scientist (Nalini Raghavachari), and the project director (Dan Evans). The Integrative Data Resource Committee (IDRC) will assemble multiple genomic data resources and perform integrative data analysis. The Computational Informatics Committee (CIC) will develop software tools that will enable novel integrative genomic analyses that will include Mendelian Randomization analysis. The Research Planning Committee (RPC) will meet annually to evaluate evidence from our statistical analyses and to develop pilot projects that will be performed to advance the translation of findings into health-promoting therapeutics. In addition, an External Advisory Board (EAB) will be formed to provide relevant scientific expertise and to foster connections with the pharmaceutical industry.

### Updates

Many components of this site are under heavy development. In the coming months, genomic resources and analytical approaches will be made available on this website that will enable others in the field to perform in-depth integrative genomic analyses using their own data. Results from our analyses will be made available for download [here](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/downloads).
